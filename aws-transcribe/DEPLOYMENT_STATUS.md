# AWS Transcribe API Deployment Status

## ‚úÖ Successfully Deployed

**API Endpoints:** 
- **POST** `https://h0lto8pesc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/transcribe`
- **GET** `https://h0lto8pesc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/status`  
- **GET** `https://h0lto8pesc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/health`

**Deployment Details:**
- ‚úÖ Lambda functions deployed successfully (3 functions)
- ‚úÖ API Gateway configured with CORS
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint working: Returns 200 OK
- ‚úÖ S3 access permissions configured
- ‚úÖ Multi-language support implemented (en-us, zh-cn, ms-my, id-id)
- ‚úÖ Error handling and validation working

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation

**IAM Permissions Issue:**
The current Lambda execution role (`s3-upload-api-dev-us-east-1-lambdaRole`) has S3 permissions but lacks Transcribe permissions:

```
AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform: transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob
```

## üîß Solution Required

To enable full functionality, the IAM role needs additional permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob",
                "transcribe:GetTranscriptionJob",
                "transcribe:ListTranscriptionJobs",
                "transcribe:DeleteTranscriptionJob"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## üß™ Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Working Endpoints
- **Health Check:** `GET /health` - Returns service status and supported languages
- **API Structure:** All endpoints respond with correct JSON format
- **CORS:** Properly configured for frontend access
- **Validation:** Input validation working correctly

### ‚è≥ Pending Full Testing
- **Transcription:** Requires IAM policy update for Transcribe permissions
- **Status Check:** Depends on successful transcription job creation

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **For AWS Academy Users:** Contact instructor to add Transcribe permissions to the Lambda role
2. **For Standard AWS Accounts:** Update the IAM role policy in AWS Console
3. **Alternative:** Create a new Lambda execution role with both S3 and Transcribe permissions

## üìã Test Commands

**Health Check (Working):**
```bash
curl "https://h0lto8pesc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/health"
```

**Transcription (Needs IAM fix):**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://h0lto8pesc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/transcribe" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://great-ai-hackathon-uploads-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/sample-audio.m4a", "language": "en-us"}'
```

**Web Interface:**
Open `test_lambda.html` in a browser for interactive testing.

**Summary:** The AWS Transcribe API is successfully deployed and functional, with only IAM permissions needed to enable full transcription capabilities.
